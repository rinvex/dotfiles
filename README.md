# Rinvex Dotfiles

Based on [Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

No extensive documentation included at the mean time, just use the original repo if you need more control.

These dotfiles prepared for internal use only, without much attention for general public usability, so use of your own risk.

1. Copy all files to your mac home directory.
2. Execute osx.sh file in your terminal to modify system preferences.
3. Install oh-my-zsh: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
4. Copy oh-my-zsh theme: `mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinvex/dotfiles/master/spaceship.zsh-theme -o ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme`
5. Done!
